# WORK STOPWATCH

> And what's ten years? Well, it's roughly how long it takes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice. Ten thousand hours is the magic number of greatness.
-- Malcom Gladwell

Have you dreamed of putting Malcom Gladwell's blanket proclamation to the test, but wilted at the thought of counting the hours for a large fraction of your life? Then this is the program for you!

This graphical stopwatch app tracks the amount of time you have spent *overall* on a certain task. It saves your progress when you close the window so that you don't have to track the time yourself. 

# Installation

## Dependencies:

* Python >3.0
* Linux Operating System (Any Distro should work, as long as you have a suitable /home/YOUR_NAME directory.)

---

1. Run install.py to copy the necessary assets into a folder in your /home/YOUR_NAME subdirectory. You can change DESTINATION in install.py to install the assets in a different place if you want.
2. That's it. Enjoy your newfound awareness of time's passage!

# Use

Run main.py to start the program, then press *start*. This button toggles the stopwatch on or off. 

When you close the program, the current time will be saved in clockSource.txt in the installation folder.
